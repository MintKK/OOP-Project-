                    <h4>1.How is the potential journey of a Member like?</h4>
                    <p> Members have the option of taking part in the various programmes and activities that suit their level
                        of commitment and volunteering experience. They may start off as Members and progress to become Leaders. </p>

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h4>2.What is the objective of regular volunteering programmes?</h4>
                    <p>Regular volunteering programmes are meant to provide a route for youths who are looking for regular interaction
                        with the beneficiaries. In addition, through trainings and interaction with beneficiaries, youth
                        volunteers will be able to attain in-depth knowledge and skills related to volunteering and committing.</p>

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h4>3.What is the commitment level like for the regular volunteering programmes? </h4>
                    <p>For effective engagement with the beneficiaries, there is a minimum of 6 months commitment. Members who sign up
                        for the regular programmes are expected to commit to the sessions within the 6-month period. Members who wish to continue
                        volunteering after the 6 months may do so by informing us.</p>

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h4>4.Is there a selection process for Members interested to join? </h4>
                    <p>There is no selection process.</p>

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h4>5.What is expected of me? </h4>
                    <p>We expect you to have a positive attitude, demonstrate patience and flexibility when you face challenges. Be sensitive
                        to their feelings and culture and contribute to a positive group experience.</p>

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h4>6.Are there any time restrictions when applying for hours?</h4>
                    <p>when you want to volunteer you will have to send us an email with:
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        - organisation you want to volunteer at
                        <br>
                        - no of people volunteering
                        <br>
                        - hours you intend to spend at the organisation
                        <br>

                    <h4>7.Why do I have to record my hours?</h4>
                    <p>So we can give you credit for your hard work! We can provide verification of hours to your school or employer,
                        or any other organization that has a community service requirement.

                        Knowing how many hours our volunteers donate is important as it allows us to quantify how much our volunteers contribute
                        to our efforts, how much work our volunteers help us accomplish, and how much we rely on you!</p>

                    <br>
